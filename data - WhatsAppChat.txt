09/03/2022, 09:20 - Markella Ikos: Good morning team! 
On behalf of the whole department, welcome onboard! We believe you will be an excellent asset to our team, we look forward to your input and we hope to achieve great things together!
Before we start, I would like to set two ground rules regarding this chat. 
Firstly, I kindly request we keep it professional, throughout the whole season we will share valuable information regarding the hotel’s operation here and its crucial to not mix it with unnecessary things so we can easily get back and trace the info.
Secondly, it goes without saying that since we are an international group of people, we only write in English in order to avoid any misunderstandings.
09/03/2022, 09:21 - Markella Ikos: Moreover, as per our previous discussion, below you will find enclosed the restaurant’s concept as well as the training manual. I strongly advise you that you study the files meticulously and get back to me if you have any questions. In the restaurant concept you will find an indicative menu with last year’s dishes as the menu is not finalized yet. Hopefully from next week we will have the revised menu for this season and I will share it with you promptly.
Please keep in mind that all the information that we share here belong to the company and are extremely confidential.
Once more I would like to welcome you to the team and in the meantime if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call or text me. Let’s have a great season, we stay in touch!
